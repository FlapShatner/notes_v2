# Notes App v2

This is a simple note-taking app built with Next.js.


## Description

This project was built for personal use and as a way to hone my skills developing with Next.js.

It uses next-auth, bcrypt, and JWT for user authorization and account management. MongoDB is utilized as a database for both user-created content and user account information. The built-in backend API makes fetching data from the database possible. 


## Using the app

After creating an account and signing in, the user can create separate collections of notes with unlimited notes per collection. All collections and notes are accessible by the owner of the content only. 


### Installation

* To install and modify the app, clone the repository and run npm install to install node modules.
